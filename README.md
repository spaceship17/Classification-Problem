Project Overview

This project explores building a product recommendation model using customer demographics (age, income) and past purchasing behavior (purchase_history_score). The target variable is whether a customer will like a given product.

Model Evaluation

Key performance metrics include:

Accuracy: Overall correct prediction rate.

Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are truly positive (minimizes false positives).

Recall: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified (minimizes false negatives).

F-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment.

These metrics are calculated from the confusion matrix, which summarizes the model's true/false positive and negative predictions.
